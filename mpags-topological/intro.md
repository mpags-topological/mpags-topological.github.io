# Introduction to Topological Phases of Matter

Welcome to our course on topological phases of matter! We hope you enjoy it and learn something from it!

We aim to give an overview of different aspects of topological physics in order to give you an idea of what it is and why it's useful. We will go through many key physical examples and toy models in order to demonstrate the key physics. Many of these examples can be found in textbooks and throughout we will provide references should you wish to learn more about a particular area.

The beginning of this course will focus largely on topological insulators and superconductors, with some experimental considerations being presented at the end of the course. We will also cover anyons and topological field theory, understanding the key components of these theories and how to perform calculations. We will also see how these theories can be used in implementations of quantum computing.

Topological physics is a vast and very active area of research and so we may not cover everthing you hope to see. If you have questions that go beyond this course or just want to read more widely then just ask! We will do our best to point you in the right direction!


This is the first year the course is being run so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
