## Fermi and Bose Statistics Revisited

All fundamental particles in Nature of one of two types: fermions or bosons. The difference between the two can be neatly summarised by what happends when we exchange a pair of indistinguishable particles.

**For bosons**, the wavefunction is symmetric under exchange:

```{figure} ../images/boson_exchange.svg
---
name: boson_exchange
width: 60%
align: center
---
```

that is, we get exactly the same state when we swap two indistinguishable bosons. 

**For fermions**, on the other hand, the wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange:

```{figure} ../images/fermion_exchange.svg
---
name: fermion_exchange
width: 60%
align: center
---
```
that is, we pick up a minus sign when we swap two indistinguishable fermions.

This small difference
