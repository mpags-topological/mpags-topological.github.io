# Lecture 4 - Topological Superconductors

In this lecture, we turn our attention from topological insulators to topological superconductors. These systems have gained increasing interest in recent years, both due to their interesting fundamental physics but also for their potential use in realising a topological quantum computer.

## The Kitaev Chain

There are many models named after Kitaev (and even others that are referred to the Kitaev chain), but here we refer to the model of a one-dimensional $p$-wave spinless superconductor. The Hamiltonian is 

$$
H = -t\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}\left(c_{j+1}^\dagger c_j + c_j^\dagger c_{j+1}\right)
$$
