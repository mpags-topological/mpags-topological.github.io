# Lecture 3 - Topological Insulators II

In the previous lecture we looked at a couple of key models in the theory of topological insulators. These were the SSH model which is a 1d topological insulator and the Haldane model which is a Chern insulator. So what's the difference between a Chern insulator and a topological insulator. Both are insulating phases with topological properties
